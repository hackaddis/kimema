Kimema Game
-------
**Alchemy Android game client based on Ethiopian context**

This project is based on the Android Alchemy Game. The basis of Alchemy established a long time ago which ultimately lead to the foundations for the modern science of chemistry in the early modern period. So alchemists wanted to transform base metals into gold or find the key to eternal life. In the same way this puzzle game will take you on the role of the early times alchemist.

The objective of the game is simple yet highly addicting, you start out with the four basic elements: Fire, Water, Air and Earth. Then you can drag and drop the elements onto each other to create other “elements”.  

This game needs to work with local elements. Combining elements should yield elements like ‘Injera’, ‘key wot’, ‘gojo’ …
